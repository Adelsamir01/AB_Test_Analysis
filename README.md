For this project, I used the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The goal is to analyze the data to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

The files here are the Jupyter  Notebook and the report for it in HTML.

Datasets are included as csv files
